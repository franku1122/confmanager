# Annotations

Annotation is a special statement that can be added at the top of the config file.
Example statement looks like this:

```text
@annotation EXAMPLE
```

Annotations always have to be at the top; otherwise they're not detected. You can also put multiple annotations
on the same statement since only 1 statement is allowed
